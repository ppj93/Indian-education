title: Sudbury Valley School 

http://www.sudval.com/01_abou_05.html

Structure:

1. general body meeting
2. judicial commitee -- students file complain, witnesses etc & decisions are made by students themselves

AIM: Self motivated learning -- children do watever they want to do & ultimately find smthing they can do as a 'carreer'





MISC:

LOGICAL REASONING HAS TO BECOME BLOOD OF THE SYSTEM .. IT SHOULD BE UBIQUITOUS IN THE SYSTEM!!

best model is:
    1. LOGICAL REASONING SHOULD PERVAID THE SYSTEM .. childrent will automaticlaly learn it
    2. children find watever they want to do in life -- exactly as in sudbury model
        - for childrent to be able to find wat they want, they should at least have one "world tour -- wat all world comprises"
        - dont know -- to understand world tour - they'll need to have some prerequisites - so might be a good thing to do it in 8th std or something like dat [ref1]. 

***THINK OF HOW YOU WOULD BRING UP YOUR OWN SON ****

STARTUP IDEAS:

CAREER COUNCILING: For 8th Std students
    - they'll have couple of yrs of preparation of watever they wanna become
    - brain is fairly developed to understand wat I wanna try out in life
    - **LOGICAL REASONING WILL BE USED THOROUGHOUT THE EXPLAINATIONS .. YOU CAN TELL THIS METHOD OF ASKING "WHY" CAN BE USED IN OTHER PARTS OF LIFE AS WELL. KEEP A FREE SESSION TO UNDERSTAND POPULARITY & UTILITY.. **
    - see [1] -- you might want to give children a world tour!
    
    
    
-- 60% india poor, education can bring fundamental impact no doubt. but question is whether to target middle-higher class or to target lower class. If we target middle-upper class now, some has to target lower class -- later. So now or later, some1 has to bring about upliftment of lower class through educatoin.


Now their basic needs are not met -- education comes after that. So you need to work in a village where der is another org working to uplift the village. You'll take responsiblity of the education affairs of that village. Student are educated usingn "best" methods of education is ur responsibility. Making sure that their saplings of education fructify to yield good responsible citizen who has taken part in nation's upliftment is your responsibilty. This you can bring about by working with their families.
-- end to end responsibility of education of students -- make sure after education, they take right decisions, interact consistently with their families .. families play main role in taking children's decisions


-- OUT COMES OF DISCUSSION WITH SAHIL --------

1. freedom must for every children. So best methodology will have 100% freedom on student's part - once de r capable of handling freedom
2. Logical component is a must --- they should develop the reasoning capability
3. Only difference would be how many steps a teacher takes when student takes 1 step - first step is expected to be taken by student
4. vishwa darshan is required initially -- so dat student can understand wat all things go on in the world
5. Parent education



---notes excerpts --
The Combine
(whoops, slipped again!) ensures a workforce that will not
rebel — the greatest fear at the turn of the 20th century
— that will be physically, intellectually, and emotionally
dependent upon corporate institutions for their incomes,
self-esteem, and stimulation, and that will learn to find
social meaning in their lives solely in the production and
consumption of material goods. We all grew up in these
institutions and we know they work. They haven’t
changed much since the 1890s because they don’t need
to – they perform precisely as they are intended.
