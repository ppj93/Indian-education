title: Sudbury Valley School 

http://www.sudval.com/01_abou_05.html

Structure:

1. general body meeting
2. judicial commitee -- students file complain, witnesses etc & decisions are made by students themselves

AIM: Self motivated learning -- children do watever they want to do & ultimately find smthing they can do as a 'carreer'





MISC:

LOGICAL REASONING HAS TO BECOME BLOOD OF THE SYSTEM .. IT SHOULD BE UBIQUITOUS IN THE SYSTEM!!

best model is:
    1. LOGICAL REASONING SHOULD PERVAID THE SYSTEM .. childrent will automaticlaly learn it
    2. children find watever they want to do in life -- exactly as in sudbury model
        - for childrent to be able to find wat they want, they should at least have one "world tour -- wat all world comprises"
        - dont know -- to understand world tour - they'll need to have some prerequisites - so might be a good thing to do it in 8th std or something like dat [ref1]. 


STARTUP IDEAS:

CAREER COUNCILING: For 8th Std students
    - they'll have couple of yrs of preparation of watever they wanna become
    - brain is fairly developed to understand wat I wanna try out in life
    - **LOGICAL REASONING WILL BE USED THOROUGHOUT THE EXPLAINATIONS .. YOU CAN TELL THIS METHOD OF ASKING "WHY" CAN BE USED IN OTHER PARTS OF LIFE AS WELL. KEEP A FREE SESSION TO UNDERSTAND POPULARITY & UTILITY.. **
    - see [1] -- you might want to give children a world tour!
