title: Sudbury Valley School 

http://www.sudval.com/01_abou_05.html

Structure:

1. general body meeting
2. judicial commitee -- students file complain, witnesses etc & decisions are made by students themselves

AIM: Self motivated learning -- children do watever they want to do & ultimately find smthing they can do as a 'carreer'





MISC:

LOGICAL REASONING HAS TO BECOME BLOOD OF THE SYSTEM .. IT SHOULD BE UBIQUITOUS IN THE SYSTEM!!

best model is:
    1. LOGICAL REASONING SHOULD PERVAID THE SYSTEM .. childrent will automaticlaly learn it
    2. children find watever they want to do in life -- exactly as in sudbury model
        - for childrent to be able to find wat they want, they should at least have one "world tour -- wat all world comprises"
        - dont know -- to understand world tour - they'll need to have some prerequisites - so might be a good thing to do it in 8th std or something like dat [ref1]. 

***THINK OF HOW YOU WOULD BRING UP YOUR OWN SON ****

STARTUP IDEAS:

CAREER COUNCILING: For 8th Std students
    - they'll have couple of yrs of preparation of watever they wanna become
    - brain is fairly developed to understand wat I wanna try out in life
    - **LOGICAL REASONING WILL BE USED THOROUGHOUT THE EXPLAINATIONS .. YOU CAN TELL THIS METHOD OF ASKING "WHY" CAN BE USED IN OTHER PARTS OF LIFE AS WELL. KEEP A FREE SESSION TO UNDERSTAND POPULARITY & UTILITY.. **
    - see [1] -- you might want to give children a world tour!
    
    
    
-- 60% india poor, education can bring fundamental impact no doubt. but question is whether to target middle-higher class or to target lower class. If we target middle-upper class now, some has to target lower class -- later. So now or later, some1 has to bring about upliftment of lower class through educatoin.


Now their basic needs are not met -- education comes after that. So you need to work in a village where der is another org working to uplift the village. You'll take responsiblity of the education affairs of that village. Student are educated usingn "best" methods of education is ur responsibility. Making sure that their saplings of education fructify to yield good responsible citizen who has taken part in nation's upliftment is your responsibilty. This you can bring about by working with their families.
-- end to end responsibility of education of students -- make sure after education, they take right decisions, interact consistently with their families .. families play main role in taking children's decisions


-- OUT COMES OF DISCUSSION WITH SAHIL --------

1. freedom must for every children. So best methodology will have 100% freedom on student's part - once de r capable of handling freedom
2. Logical component is a must --- they should develop the reasoning capability
3. Only difference would be how many steps a teacher takes when student takes 1 step - first step is expected to be taken by student
4. vishwa darshan is required initially -- so dat student can understand wat all things go on in the world
5. Parent education

The Combine
(whoops, slipped again!) ensures a workforce that will not
rebel — the greatest fear at the turn of the 20th century
— that will be physically, intellectually, and emotionally
dependent upon corporate institutions for their incomes,
self-esteem, and stimulation, and that will learn to find
social meaning in their lives solely in the production and
consumption of material goods. We all grew up in these
institutions and we know they work. They haven’t
changed much since the 1890s because they don’t need
to – they perform precisely as they are intended.

• As society rapidly changes, individuals will have to
be able to function comfortably in a world that is
always in flux. Knowledge will continue to increase
at a dizzying rate. This means that a content-based
curriculum, with a set body of information to be
imparted to students, is entirely inappropriate as a
means of preparing children for their adult roles.

• People will be faced with greater individual respon-
sibility to direct their own lives. Children must grow
up in an environment that stresses self-motivation
and self -assessment. Schools that focus on external
motivating factors, such as rewards and punish-
ments for meeting goals set by others, are denying
children the tools they need most to survive.

• The ability to communicate with others, to share
experiences, to collaborate, and to exchange infor-
mation is critical. Conversation, the ultimate means
of communication, must be a central part of a
sound education.

• As the world moves toward universal recognition of
individual rights within a democratic society, peo-
ple must be empowered to participate as equal
partners in whatever enterprise they are engaged in.
Students (and teachers) require full participation in
running educational institutions, including the
right to radically change them when needed.

• Technology now makes it possible for individuals to
learn whatever they wish, whenever they wish, and in
the manner they wish. Students should be empow-
ered with both the technology and the responsibility
for their own learning and educational timetable.

• Children have an immense capacity for concentra-
tion and hard work when they are passionate about
what they are doing, and the skills they acquire in
any area of interest are readily transferable to other
fields. Schools must thus become far more tolerant
of individual variation and far more reliant on self-
initiated activities.


 But I also imagine that the capacity to form
one’s own convictions independent of what was being
taught in the classroom, the ability to think critically
based upon one’s own experience, would not rank high
on many lists. 

As parents, we all want what
is “best” for our children. Yet, by our own actions and
lifestyles, and through the demands that we place on our
educational institutions, it is clear that by “best” we all
too often mean “most.” This shift from the qualitative
to the quantitative, from thinking about what is best or
the holistic development of the individual human being

The first lesson I teach is confu-
sion. Everything I teach is out of context. I teach the
un-relating of everything. I teach disconnections. I teach
too much: the orbiting of planets, the law of large num-
bers, slavery, adjectives, architectural drawing, dance,
gymnasium, choral singing, assemblies, surprise guests,
fire drills, computer languages, parents’ nights, staff-
development days, pull-out programs, guidance with
strangers my students may never see again, standardized
tests, age-segregation unlike anything seen in the outside
world ... What do any of these things have to do with
each other?

Meaning, not disconnected facts, is what sane
human beings seek
Behind the patch-
work quilt of school sequences and the school obsession
with facts and theories, the age-old human search for
meaning lies well concealed. T

 If I do my job well, the kids can’t even
imagine themselves somewhere else because I’ve shown

them how to envy and fear the better classes and how to
have contempt for the dumb classes. Under this efficient
discipline the class mostly polices itself into good march-
ing order. 

3. INDIFFERENCE
The third lesson I teach is indifference. I teach children
not to care too much about anything, even though they
want to make it appear that they do. How I do this is
very subtle. I do it by demanding that they become
totally involved in my lessons, jumping up and down in
their seats with anticipation, competing vigorously with
each other for my favor. It’s heartwarming when they
do that; it impresses everyone, even me. When I’m at
my best I plan lessons very carefully in order to produce

this show of enthusiasm. But when the bell rings I insist
they drop whatever it is we have been doing and pro-
ceed quickly to the next work station. They must turn
on and off like a light switch. Nothing important is ever
finished in my class nor in any class I know of. Students
never have a complete experience except on the install-
ment plan.

4. E MOTIONAL DEPENDENCY
The fourth lesson I teach is emotional dependency. By stars
and red checks, smiles and frowns, prizes, honors, and
disgraces, I teach kids to surrender their will to the pre-
destinated chain of command. Rights may be granted or
withheld by any authority without appeal, because rights
do not exist inside a school — not even the right of free
speech, as the Supreme Court has ruled — unless school
authorities say they do. As a schoolteacher, I intervene in
many personal decisions, issuing a pass for those I deem
legitimate and initiating a disciplinary confrontation for
behavior that threatens my control. Individuality is con-
stantly trying to assert itself among children and
teenagers, so my judgments come thick and fast.
Individuality is a contradiction of class theory, a curse to
all systems of classification.

5. INTELLECTUAL DEPENDENCY
The fifth lesson I teach is intellectual dependency. Good
students wait for a teacher to tell them what to do. This
is the most important lesson of them all: we must wait
for other people, better trained than ourselves, to make
the meanings of our lives. The expert makes all the
important choices; only I, the teacher, can determine
what my kids must study, or rather, only the people who
pay me can make those decisions, which I then enforce.
If I’m told that evolution is a fact instead of a theory, I
transmit that as ordered, punishing deviants who resist
what I have been told to tell them to think. This power
to control what children will think lets me separate suc-
cessful students from failures very easily.

Successful children do the thinking I assign them
with a minimum of resistance and a decent show of

enthusiasm. Of the millions of things of value to study, I
decide what few we have time for. Actually, though, this
is decided by my faceless employers. The choices are
theirs — why should I argue? Curiosity has no important
place in my work, only conformity.

6. PROVISIONAL SELF-ESTEEM
The sixth lesson I teach is provisional self-esteem. If you’ve
ever tried to wrestle into line kids whose parents have
convinced them to believe they’ll be loved in spite of
anything, you know how impossible it is to make self-
confident spirits conform. Our world wouldn’t survive a
flood of confident people very long, so I teach that a
kid’s self-respect should depend on expert opinion. My
kids are constantly evaluated and judged.
(he kam amchan jampa na re baba attitude after 10th n seeing grades of 60%)

A monthly report, impressive in its provision, is sent
into a student’s home to elicit approval or mark exactly,
down to a single percentage point, how dissatisfied with
the child a parent should be. 

The lesson of report cards, grades, and tests is that
children should not trust themselves or their parents but
should instead rely on the evaluation of certified officials.
People need to be told what they are worth.

7. ONE CAN’T HIDE
The seventh lesson I teach is that one can’t hide. I teach stu-
dents that they are always watched, that each is under
constant surveillance by me and my colleagues. There
are no private spaces for children; there is no private
time. Class change lasts exactly three hundred seconds to
keep promiscuous fraternization at low levels. Students
are encouraged to tattle on each other or even to tattle
on their own parents. Of course, I encourage parents to
file reports about their own child’s waywardness too. A
family trained to snitch on itself isn’t likely to conceal
any dangerous secrets.

I assign a type of extended schooling called “home-
work,” so that the effect of surveillance, if not the
surveillance itself, travels into private households, where
students might otherwise use free time to learn some-
thing unauthorized from a father or mother, by
exploration or by apprenticing to some wise person in
the neighborhood. Disloyalty to the idea of schooling is
a devil always ready to find work for idle hands.

It is the great triumph of compulsory government
monopoly mass schooling that among even the best of
my fellow teachers, and among even the best of my stu-
dents’ parents, only a small number can imagine a
different way to do things. “The kids have to know how
to read and write, don’t they?” “They have to know how
to add and subtract, don’t they?” “They have to learn to
follow orders if they ever expect to keep a job.”
Only a few lifetimes ago things were very different
in the United States. Originality and variety were com-
mon currency; our freedom from regimentation made us
the miracle of the world; social-class boundaries were
relatively easy to cross; our citizenry was marvelously
confident, inventive, and able to do much for themselves
independently, and to think for themselves.
